# Bean-to-Phant Logger

Use the [LightBlue Bean](http://punchthrough.com/bean/) to log data over time.

Save your data to Sparkfun's [free IoT storage service](https://data.sparkfun.com/) running [Phant](http://phant.io/).

[Punch Through Design](http://punchthrough.com) has a data stream that uses a Bean with an attached light sensor. [Check it out live!]()

# Setup

1. Copy `sample_config.py` to `config.py`.
2. Edit `config.py`, setting your public/private keys and your desired logging interval.
3. Install the Python script's requirements with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Connect to your Bean with the Bean Loader App.
5. Program your Bean with `logger_sketch/logger_sketch.ino`.
6. Use your Bean as a Virtual Serial device by right-clicking on it and selecting the menu option.

# Usage

1. Run the script with `python3 logger.py`.
2. Watch data flow into your Sparkfun data stream!
